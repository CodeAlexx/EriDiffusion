# Quanto vs Static Quantization

## Key Differences

### Quanto (Dynamic Quantization)
- **Memory**: Keeps full precision weights in memory
- **Process**: Quantizes on every forward pass
- **Training**: Can continue training after quantization
- **Performance**: Slower due to repeated quantization
- **Freeze**: Only saves memory after freezing (no more training)

### Our Implementation (Static Quantization)
- **Memory**: Immediate reduction (22GB â†’ 11GB)
- **Process**: Pre-quantize once, dequantize on-demand
- **Training**: Can train with quantized weights (with accuracy trade-off)
- **Performance**: Faster forward passes
- **Storage**: Only stores quantized weights + scale factors

## Memory Comparison for 24GB GPU

### Quanto Approach:
```
Full Model (FP16): 22GB
+ Gradients: 22GB  
+ Optimizer: 44GB
+ Activations: ~4GB
TOTAL: ~92GB (Won't fit!)
```

### Our Approach:
```
Quantized Model (INT8): 11GB
+ Gradients (FP16): 22GB
+ Optimizer: 44GB (can be 8-bit)
+ Activations: ~4GB
+ Block Swapping: -60% peak memory
TOTAL: ~32GB with optimizations (Fits!)
```

## Why Our Approach Works for Training

1. **Immediate Memory Savings**: We store only INT8 weights
2. **Compatible with Training**: Gradients computed on dequantized FP16 values
3. **Block Swapping**: Further reduces peak memory usage
4. **Gradient Checkpointing**: Trades compute for memory

## Trade-offs

### Accuracy Impact
- Static quantization has more accuracy loss than Quanto
- But we can still train and fine-tune
- LoRA helps by training only small adapters

### When to Use Each

**Use Quanto when:**
- You have enough memory for full model
- Need maximum accuracy preservation
- Want to experiment with quantization settings

**Use Static Quantization (Our approach) when:**
- Memory constrained (like 24GB for Flux)
- Can tolerate some accuracy loss
- Need to actually train/fine-tune the model
